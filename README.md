# Rocket-Elevators-Python-Controller
This project is part of my second coding bootcamp project (October 2022) and implements an elevator control system design that passes all the provided tests. 

## Introduction
The Elevator Control System is designed to manage and control the movement of elevators within a building. It provides functions and algorithms to handle elevator requests, floor destinations, and elevator state management. 

## Other Language version:
[Javascript](https://github.com/0xJungleMonkey/Rocket-Elevators-Javascript-Controller/)
[C#](https://github.com/0xJungleMonkey/Rocket-Elevators-Controller-CSharp)
[Golang](https://github.com/0xJungleMonkey/Rocket-Elevators-Controller-Golang)

### Installation

First, depending on your python version, make sure to install the Package Installer for Python (PIP) if needed:

https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

Next, install Pytest:

https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/getting-started.html

### Running the tests

To launch the tests:
`pytest`

With a fully completed project, you should get an output like:

You can also get more details about each test by adding the `-v` flag: 

`pytest -v` 

which should give something like:
